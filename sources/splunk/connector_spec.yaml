  parameters:
    - name: host
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        Splunk server hostname or IP address (without protocol or port).
        For Splunk Enterprise, use your server's hostname or IP address.
        For Splunk Cloud, use your cloud instance URL
        (e.g., prd-p-xxxxx.splunkcloud.com).

    - name: port
      type: integer
      required: false
      description: >
        Splunk management port for REST API access. Defaults to 8089 if not
        specified. The standard management port is 8089 for most Splunk
        installations.

    - name: username
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        Splunk username with appropriate permissions for API access. The user
        must have the 'list_metrics_catalog' capability assigned through a role
        to access metrics catalog endpoints.

    - name: password
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        Password for the Splunk user account. Store securely and use appropriate
        access controls. For production, consider using Databricks secrets.

    - name: verify_ssl
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: >
        Whether to verify SSL certificates when connecting to Splunk. Defaults
        to false. Set to true in production environments with valid SSL
        certificates. Use false for development or when using self-signed
        certificates.

# ============================================================================
# External Options Allowlist
# These table-specific options must be included in the externalOptionsAllowList
# parameter of the UC connection to allow them to be passed through.
# Use a comma-separated string of option names.
# If no table-specific options are needed, set to empty string or omit.
# ============================================================================
# NOTE: Currently empty because the connector does not yet use table_options.
# Future enhancements will add filtering options for: index, metric_name,
# dimension, dimension_value, app, earliest_time, latest_time, search_query
